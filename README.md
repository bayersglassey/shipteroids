# SHIPTEROIDS

This is a game about flying a spaceship around, shooting asteroids and
getting into trouble with other spaceships.

The core gameplay is loosely based on the classic Asteroids, but with
the idea of having many different types of spaceship, each with its
own weapons and abilities (which can get quite strange -- for example,
one ship is a swarm of little ships connected by springs; other "ships"
are astronauts which can land on asteroids and run around on them).

The entire game is in a single HTML file: [index.html](/index.html).
All the code, graphics, etc are contained in that file.
The language is Javascript (ES6) and HTML5 (canvas etc).
